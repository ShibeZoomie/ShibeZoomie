<h3 align="center">Full time IT professional, reawakening my love for programming.</h3><br>

Some just for fun projects I like to work on in my free time:
- IoT development on ESP32/ESP8266 modules.
- Django web development.
- Programming bots in Python, plus Machine Learning. *(ML at a very very **very** fundamental level)*
- Fixing my Arch Linux installation.
- *(I use Arch btw)*
- Esolangs (Brain!@#$)
