<h1 align="center">Hi! 👋 ShibeZoomie here!</h1>
<h3 align="center">Full time IT professional, part time student. Reawakening my love for programming.</h3><br>

Some just for fun projects I like to work on in my free time:
- IoT development on ESP32/ESP8266 modules.
- Django web development.
- Programming bots in Python, plus Machine Learning. *(ML at a very very **very** fundamental level)*
- Fixing my Arch Linux installation.
- *(I use Arch btw)*
- Esolangs (Brain!@#$)

Recently I became interested in mobile app development and have since gotten a basic understanding of Kotlin. Kotlin is fun, but I want to shift my focus to Flutter (and thus Dart).
